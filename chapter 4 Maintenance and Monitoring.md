### Managing versions

This is a service update from one version to another 

fro deploying breaking version be sure to iclude changes

Need to test versions before going live 


__rolling update__ allows you to deploy new version with no downtime

use __blue/green__ deployment when you dont want multiple version of service to run simultneously

    blue --> current
    green --> creating completly new environment

__Cananry update__ can be used prior to rolling update to reduce the risk.
